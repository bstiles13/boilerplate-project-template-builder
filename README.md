# Cheat Code - A Project Template Builder

Cheat Code is front and backend app that quickly builds the run of the mill starter files we all hate to create for every project.

It allows the user to quickly select the libraries and/or frameworks from a dynamic list, then builds the boiler plate code for all the appropriate files, puts them in their proper directories, zips it all up, and delivers a single file to the user ready to unzip and use.

The project was built with React and Bulma on the front end. Node.js, Express runs the back of the house.
