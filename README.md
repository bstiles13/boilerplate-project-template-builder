# Cheat Code - A Project Template Builder

Boilerplate is front and backend app that quickly builds the run of the mill starter files we all hate to create for every project.

It allows the user to quickly select the libraries and/or frameworks from a dynamic list, then builds the boiler plate code for all the appropriate files, puts them in their proper directories, zips it all up, and delivers a single file to the user ready to unzip and use.

The user can write and access saved templates and snippets. Snippets are small code blocks that are inserted into templates at the location of a custom marker. The application provides interfaces to edit and save to the database both new templates and snippets. Markers are written in "tie-fighter" notation. {--nodecode--}. See images below.

The project was built with Bootstrap and Javascript on the front end. Node.js, Express with Handlebars, and a SQL database run the back of house.
